            <h2>Consistent Training for Consistent Results</h2>
            <p>"To be solid brings confidence and reduces anxiety. To be solid does not mean to be a defensive player." – Sergi Bruguera</p>
            <p>Consistent players win a lot of tennis matches, and consistency is the foundation for future high-level play. Our training program is built on this principle, helping young players develop the resilience and skills needed for long-term success.</p>
